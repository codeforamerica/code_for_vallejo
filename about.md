Welcome to the official website for Code for America's 2015 Fellowship team working with the City of Vallejo, California.

<b>WHAT?</b>
For 2015, we will be building digital tools intended to help Vallejoans to feel safer. We spent February living in Vallejo and meeting with government, community and faith leaders. For the rest of the year, we will work from Code for America's San Francisco office while making frequent visits to Vallejo. If you would like us to come meet with your community, please contact us at Vallejo@codeforamerica.org.

CODE FOR AMERICA
Code for America Fellowships build technological tools that make city governments work "for the people, by the people in the 21st century." This year, teams of three have been assigned to work with 8 different U.S. cities to help them redesign systems that govern business development, healthcare access, procurement, food distribution, and public safety. We want to improve ways that residents interact with their cities. You can read more about fellowship projects developed in previous years <a href=" http://www.codeforamerica.org/apps/;>here</a>.

<b> WHY? </b>
Dan Keen, Vallejo's City Manager, applied for a 2015 Code for America Fellowship team for the City because he wanted city government to provide better services. Vallejo was chosen as one of 8 partner municipalities for Code for America's 2015 Fellowship program (over 40 applied). More details can be found [here](http://www.codeforamerica.org/governments/vallejo/).

Vallejo has gone through a lot in the past decade: painful experiences such as bankruptcy and violence, but also remarkable resiliency displayed by the passionate communities whom we came to see everyday when we were living with you in February. We're very excited to work with you and to be part of this project.
