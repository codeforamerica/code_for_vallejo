Welcome to the official website for Code for America's 2015 Fellowship team working with the City of Vallejo, California.

<b>WHAT?</b>
This is a yearlong effort to collaboratively build digital tools for Vallejoans to more easily participate in shaping what public safety looks like in their communities. What does that mean? What kind of tools? You can read more  

Code for America Fellowships build technological tools that make city governments work "for the people, by the people in the 21st century." This year, teams of three have been assigned to work with 8 different U.S. cities to help them redesign systems that govern business development, healthcare access, procurement, food distribution, and public safety. We want to improve ways that residents interact with their cities. You can read more about fellowship projects developed in previous years <a href=" http://www.codeforamerica.org/apps/;>here</a>.


Over 40 U.S. cities applied to be 2015 Code for America Fellowship cities and 8 were chosen including

<b> WHY? </b>
The Vallejo City Manager's office applied for a Code for America Fellowship because it's a ripe moment for change.


During the course of the year, 3 fellows with backgrounds in web development, research, design, and law will work with the City of Vallejo and its residents to build a digital tool intended to improve relations between police and the community. Vallejo was chosen as one of 8 partner municipalities for Code for America's 2015 Fellowship program (over 40 applied). More details can be found [here](http://www.codeforamerica.org/governments/vallejo/).

Vallejo, coined the most diverse city in the country, has people with diverse perspectives and needs. Fellows spent the month of February living in Vallejo, researching, listening, and building relationships with leaders from community and government. The goal is to build a tool that serves the interests of those who live and work in Vallejo. They'll be back in Vallejo regularly to hold events and to get feedback for their work. Please be a part of our work by reaching out to us: vallejo@codeforamerica.org.
