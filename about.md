The city of Vallejo was chosen as one of 8 partner municipalities for Code for America's 2015 Fellowship program. Over 40 cities submitted applications. More details can be found [here](http://www.codeforamerica.org/governments/vallejo/).

During the course of the year, 3 fellows with backgrounds in web development, research, design, and law will work with the City and its residents to build a digital tool intended to improve relations between police and the community. Vallejo, coined the most diverse city in the country, has people with diverse persepctives and needs. Fellows spent the month of February living in Vallejo, researching, listening, and building relationships with leaders from community and government. The goal is to build a tool that serves the interests of those who live and work in Vallejo. They'll be back in Vallejo regularly to hold events and to get feedback for their work. Please be a part of our work by reaching out to us: vallejo@codeforamerica.org.

If you represent or are a member of a Vallejoan community that we should be in touch with, please let us know so that we can make the connection. You can also send our surveys [create a page for surveys, link to it here] to your community members so that we can connect with them that way.

Thank you!
