Welcome to the official website for Code for America's 2015 Fellowship team working with the City of Vallejo, California.

For 2015, we will be building digital tools intended to help make Vallejoans feel safer in the City. We spent February living in Vallejo and meeting with government, community and faith leaders to learn more about public safety issues impacting Vallejo residents. For the rest of the year, we will work from Code for America's San Francisco office while making frequent visits to Vallejo for feedback and collaboration.

We're Nikki, Jazmyn and Andrew and we have backgrounds in social science research, law, design, and web development. You can learn more about our individual bios [here](http://www.codeforamerica.org/governments/vallejo/).

Organizations that we've learned from so far include:

<b>CODE FOR AMERICA</b>

Code for America Fellowships build technological tools that make city governments work "for the people, by the people in the 21st century." This year, teams of three have been assigned to work with 8 different U.S. cities to help them redesign systems that govern business development, healthcare access, procurement, food distribution, and public safety. We want to improve ways that residents interact with their cities. You can read more about fellowship projects developed in previous years [here](http://www.codeforamerica.org/apps/).


Thank you!
