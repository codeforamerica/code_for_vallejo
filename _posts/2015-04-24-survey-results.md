We received over 200 responses to our first survey. Thank you to all of those who participated!

The map above shows the distribution of where survey respondents live in Vallejo (all but 8 respondents reported they currently live here). Do you have recommendations on how we might better connect in areas with less representation? Please [let us know](mailto:vallejo@codeforamerica.org)!

Some additional results:

* Two-thirds of have lived in Vallejo for more than 10 years.
* The average age was about 55.
* About half of respondents use NextDoor.
