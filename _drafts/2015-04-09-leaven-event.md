On April 9th, we partnered with <a href="http://www.myleaven.com">The Leaven's</a> after school center at Marina Vista apartments to facilitate an urban planning workshop with kids off for spring break. The theme of our workshop was "Let's Make Our Own City," and together we brainstormed about the places that we'd like our city to have, the things we'd like to do there and the people that we'd like to have there. What if we could participate in shaping the spaces that we live in? What would they look like?

Our results? We created a lot of homes - both apartment buildings and houses; we had a church; a police department; a fire department actively putting out a burning building; a nail salon; and a park. We had flowers and a baby chick, lots of families, and we had hearts (including one big one that we decided belonged on the police department's roof) because all cities need love.
We had an amazing time and couldn't have done it without Miss Anita from the Leaven and Granny Faye who assembled a crowd of 30 participants.
